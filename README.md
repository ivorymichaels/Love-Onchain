# Love-Onchain
Your Gateway to Web3 Dating


##Introduction
Traditional social and dating platforms are typically managed by companies that control users' data, actions, and relationships. Also, many people from different walks of life are so engrossed in their daily activities that they end up living a lonely life, having no one to talk to or share their lives with and in the end, having difficulties finding love. 

While these platforms have been successful, most of them often cater to specific regions or have strayed from their original purpose.  often bring about familiar challenges like restricted freedoms, social disconnection, intrusive moderation, and privacy concerns. Love-Onchain is here to change that narrative for the African community, helping people find love and friendship that is meaningful and local.

Life in Web2 vs Life in Web3

In Web2,
You need to wake up very early
You can never beat the traffic.
Transportation is high

The truth is, We all need love whether you are in Web2 or Web3. Unfortunately, most people will tell you that they do not have time for love especially in Lagos Nigeria.
